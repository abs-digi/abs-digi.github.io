This is my collection of books to read, have read and am reading. Most of the self help books i haven’t read yet but plan to soon. I’m on Atomic Habits digital version right now and I’m almost finished with it. I’m also reading The Shadow of the Gods, an actual book, slowly. I plan to add more of my collection of books later, I’m just trying to get this website up and running. I’ve a large collection of Stephen King which seems daunting to catalog. I’ve all The Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan including New Springs and Eye of the World part 1: From the Two Rivers. I never finished it but plan to read it soon. I’ve too many actual books to get anymore. There’s just no room and I don’t want to get rid of what i have.
