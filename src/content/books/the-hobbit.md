## Example Section

In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

> All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
   by: J.R.R. Tolkien

## Rating Explanation

This book is a timeless classic. It sets the stage perfectly for The Lord of the Rings but stands on its own as a wonderful adventure. Bilbo's growth from a homebody to a burglar is one of my favorite character arcs.
