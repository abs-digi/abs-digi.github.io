A digital garden is fundamentally different from a blog. While a blog is a time-ordered stream of finished articles, a garden is a collection of evolving, interconnected notes.  You can use **bold**, *italics*, and lists.

* Point 1
* Point 2

Based on your content.config.ts file, the three phases (statuses) defined for your digital garden pages are:

    🌿 budding

    🌳 evergreen

These are defined in the projects collection schema, which is what powers the pages under your /digital-garden URL.
