I’ve finished The Devils by: Joe Abercrombie. I think there was too much werewolf boinking going on in The Devils. I don’t think ill be reading anymore self help books though. I’ve Bought some Audible books too. I’ve listened to one of Conans adventures “Beyond the Black River” by Rober E. Howard. It was a bit racist if you ask me. Guess thats just the times it was written in. “The Stranger Beside Me: Ted Bundy” by: Ann Rule just disappointed me in America and the detective work therein. So many people saw him, knew his car and he still got away with all kinds of shit. Sick fuck. I DNF’d it. I finished the first three in a series of The First Law by Joe Abercrombie. They were pretty good.
