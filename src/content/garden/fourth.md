<p>Okay, update. The domain names digi.yo and the other were handshake names. Dont know anything about them but they dont work in browsers. I returned them for this domain name abs-garden.com. It’s a little bit longer but its .com. Took forever. I guess the translators were down or something.</p>
<p>**12-17-2025** Oh man, I went to codeberg with my site, contemplated going  to gitlab, but went to codeberg. I couldnt get my domain name to work with anything i did. Soooo,,, I'm back with github. The domain name is working and im setting everything up again.
