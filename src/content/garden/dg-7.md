<p>I've went from 11ty to Hugo to Jekyll to Astro. 11ty was probably the easiest to setup. Jekyll had works with Github and Astro.js I thought would be more fun because the sites looked more active. All given it is a static site generator, they all seem about the same. Different languages, different file systems but still an SSG.</p>
<p>11ty is supposed to not care about the file system as much. Astro.js only loads called for .js to make the site run faster. Jekyll has Github and Hugo has been around longer i think. I'm with Astro.js right now but the file system is large and confusing. I've been useing AI to help with building it. I'm kinda new to SSG's and a noob-like to GIT and Obsidian. Refreshing i guess you could say.</p>
